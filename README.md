This repository contains a structured portfolio of data analytics and visualization dashboards developed using Power BI, Tableau, Python (Matplotlib), Excel, SQL, and Pandas.
The projects demonstrate end-to-end analytical workflows, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, KPI definition, and insight-driven storytelling through dashboards.

The dashboards address real-world business use cases such as sales performance analysis, customer churn prediction, operational monitoring, and trend analysis, emphasizing data-driven decision making and visual clarity.

Interactive dashboards (Power BI & Tableau) are complemented by custom visualizations built with Matplotlib, showcasing the ability to design analytical views programmatically as well as through BI tools.
This repository is intended to reflect practical skills aligned with data analyst and data science internship roles.
